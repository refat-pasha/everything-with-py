1. You are given a list of students with their marks in a subject. Write a Python function to store the data in a
dictionary where the key is the student's name and the value is their mark. Then, find and return the student
with the highest mark.
Sample Input: student_scores = [('Alice', 85), ('Bob', 90), ('Charlie', 80)]
Sample Output: {'Alice': 85, 'Bob': 90, 'Charlie': 80}
                            Top Student: Bob with 90 marks

2. Find the largest element from a given list without using the library function.

3. Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way

• Create an outer function that will accept two parameters, a and b
• Create an inner function inside an outer function that will calculate the addition of a and b
• At last, an outer function will add 5 into addition and return it

4. Given is a nested tuple. Write a program to modify the list's first item (22) inside the following tuple to 222.
Sample Input: (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)
Sample Output: (11, [222, 33], 44, 55)

5. A fitness center wants to track the progress of its members based on the number of workouts they complete each week.
 You are asked to create a Python program that takes a list of members and their weekly workout counts over several
 weeks and calculates the total number of workouts for each member.
• It takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the member's name and a list of their weekly workout counts.
• It uses a loop to calculate the total workouts for each member.
• Returns a dictionary with each member's name as the key and their total number of workouts as the value.
Sample Input: members_workouts = [ ('John', [3, 4, 2, 5]), ('Emily', [5, 3, 4, 4]), ('Sam', [2, 2, 3, 3]) ]
Output: { 'John': 14, 'Emily': 16, 'Sam': 10 }
